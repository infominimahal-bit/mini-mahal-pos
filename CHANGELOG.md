# 📜 SCHEMA CHANGE LOG (AUDIT TRAIL)

Whenever a database change is made, it MUST be recorded here.

### [2026-08-19] Master schema + clone guide verified for fresh clone (closed 2 clone-breaking gaps)
**Files:** `supabase/schema/SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `docs/setup.md`
**Context:** Verified the repo is clone-ready (fresh `git clone` → new Supabase project → push `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql` must create a fully-working DB). Found 2 migrations whose effects were MISSING from the master schema (would break a fresh clone even though the live DB had them applied individually):
- `20260820040000_add_payment_status_column.sql` → added `payment_status TEXT DEFAULT 'paid'` to `sales` (code sets it on create/refund/delete; missing column = cloud insert failure).
- `20260820050000_customer_ledger.sql` → added `customer_ledger` table + indexes + `customers.balance` column + anon `SELECT/ALL` RLS policy + realtime publication entry (code writes/reads it for per-customer running balance).
Also fixed a stale comment on `delete_sale_atomic`/`refund_sale_atomic` (they are ROLE-GATE-FREE / anon-compatible, over-refund cap kept — already confirmed permissive in live RPCs). `docs/setup.md` updated to match real schema: table count 21→24 (added `customer_ledger`, `salesmen`), function count 12→16 (added `commit_sale`, `apply_payment_movements`, `delete_sale_atomic`, `refund_sale_atomic`), `sales` columns (`status`,`payment_status`,`edited_from_invoice`), `customers.balance`, and realtime publication list (24 tables, incl. `customer_ledger`+`salesmen`, matching schema's `product_addons` not `product_batches`). Removed stray scratch files (`deep_fix_mds*.py`, `fix_*.py`, `update_mds.py`, `test-zindex.js`) for a clean clone.
**Verified:** all key objects present in master schema (commit_sale, apply_payment_movements, get_next_invoice_number, salesmen, variant_stock_history, row_tombstones, guard_stale_write, record_row_tombstone, oversell guard, edited_from_invoice, customer_ledger, payment_status). tsc clean; system reconciliation per attached verification report (revenue/wallets/stock/inventory all match).

### [2026-08-18] Receipt shows "EDITED FROM INV #X" for edited (corrected) bills
**Files:** `src/components/pos/ReceiptPrint.tsx`
**Context:** When a finalized bill is edited, the app creates a NEW corrected invoice linked via `sale.editedFromInvoice` (original invoice #). The eye-icon `TransactionDetailModal` already showed the edit banner, but the **printed/shared receipt** did not. Added an `editWatermark` (purple `*** EDITED FROM INV #<original> ***`) mirrored on all 11 receipt layouts next to the existing `refundWatermark`. The corrected bill's receipt now clearly states it was edited from the original invoice (tax/FBR audit trail on paper).
**Note:** Code committed+pushed; live Vercel app still runs OLD code until a fresh deploy (token invalid).

### [2026-08-18] ALL-actions inventory + balance accuracy — magnitude guards (no sign flips)
**Files:** `src/lib/services.ts`
**Context (master directive — "all actions inventory + balance accuracy"):** After the negative-quantity inventory bug (INV-001030/001032/001035 had `total:-5000` and flipped a −5 OUT into a +5 IN, corrupting stock), the fix must be defensive on EVERY stock-affecting path so no future action can flip a sign. Applied `Math.abs(Number(...)||0)` magnitude safety to ALL stock movements and wallet/payment deltas:
- Sale create (deduction) — `qty = Math.abs(item.weight||item.quantity)`.
- Sale delete reversal — `itemQtyMag = abs(itemQty)`, `qty = max(0, itemQtyMag - refunded)`.
- Refund/return (simple + variant + add-on) — `qty = abs(reqItem.qty)` for stock restoration and `refundedQuantity`.
- Wallet/payment balances — `buildSalePaymentMoves` (forward) + `buildReversePaymentMoves` (reverse) now use `Math.abs` so a negative sale total cannot corrupt a wallet balance (forward credits |total|, reverse debits |total| → stays balanced).
**Verification:** Live jz DB broad scan returned **0 products with stock ≠ ledger sum** (only 2 products, both `stock=ledger=90`). tsc clean. NOTE: `Math.abs` guards protect inventory+balance from sign flips, but a negative-quantity item STILL yields a negative sale revenue total — a separate cart/stepper guard (reject negative qty at sale creation) is recommended to also fix revenue; not yet added.
**Deploy status:** Code committed+pushed but the Vercel token is invalid (`invalidToken:true`) so the live app still runs OLD code until a fresh deploy — data repaired directly on cloud, app refresh pulls corrected rows.

### [2026-08-18] Delete/void reliability — stock now always reverses (fixes per-device drift)
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260820100000_delete_sale_permissive.sql` (NEW, applied live), `supabase/schema/SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `src/lib/services.ts`, `src/lib/syncEngine.ts`
**Context (real-shop accuracy):** Deleting a sale must reverse its stock on the cloud ledger, every time. Two bugs broke this:
1. `delete_sale_atomic` enforced `require_action(..., 'admin','manager')` — but this anon-key single-tenant architecture cannot enforce roles (MASTER §2.1.4 already dropped for commit_sale/refund/apply_payment_movements). A rejected/transient delete left the sale `status='completed'` in cloud with stock NEVER reversed → inventory drifted (owner saw boys t-shirt −10 / jeans −9 after "deleting all bills"; 2 sales stayed `completed` while 18 deleted correctly).
2. The queued-delete replay in `syncEngine` called `delete_sale_atomic(id, p_history: [])` with **empty history**, so even a successful replay did not reverse stock.
**Fix:** (1) `delete_sale_atomic` is now permissive (role gate removed — consistent with anon-compat revert) so every delete reliably hard-deletes the sale AND reverses stock. (2) `services.delete()` now embeds the reversal movements in the queued op (`queueOp('sales','delete', id, { history: returnMovements })`), and `syncEngine` replays them (`p_history: op.payload.history || []`). Result: on every action (sale, delete, void) stock stays accurate across all devices. The 2 drifted products were repaired live (inserted the missing return movements + tombstoned the sales) — broad scan then confirmed **0 products** with stock ≠ ledger sum.
**Applied live:** jz 2026-08-18 (RPC replaced via Management API).

### [2026-08-18] Refund/return reliability — refund_sale_atomic permissive (same class as delete)
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260820110000_refund_sale_permissive.sql` (NEW, applied live), `supabase/schema/SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`
**Context:** `refund_sale_atomic` enforced `require_action(..., 'admin','manager','cashier')`. Same anon-key single-tenant incompatibility as delete: a rejected/transient refund left the sale status unchanged AND its stock unreversed on the RPC path (the app's offline fallback — `applyStockMovementsRemote` + queued `stock_history` — does recover it, but the primary online RPC should be reliable). `process_return` (the queued-sale replay path) only flips sale status and does NOT touch stock, so there is no double-reversal. Made `refund_sale_atomic` permissive (role gate removed, over-refund cap kept) — consistent with delete_sale_atomic fix and anon-compat revert. All financial RPCs (`commit_sale`, `delete_sale_atomic`, `refund_sale_atomic`, `apply_payment_movements`) are now role-gate-free; the only remaining guards are anon-safe `auth.uid()` checks (skipped when null).
**Applied live:** jz 2026-08-18 (RPC replaced via Management API).

### [2026-08-18] Permission/RBAC hardening — close data-leakage + unguarded destructive actions (MASTER §2)
**Files:** `src/lib/permissions.ts` (pre-existing matrix, reused), `src/components/settings/DatabaseTools.tsx`, `src/components/discounts/DiscountManager.tsx`, `src/components/layout/SyncQueueManager.tsx`, `src/components/customers/CustomerManager.tsx`, `src/App.tsx` (pre-existing `RequireAccess`), `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` (pre-existing real-role load)
**Audit result:** The RBAC scaffold described as "missing/no-op" in `MASTER_AGENT_REPAIR_AND_VERIFY.md §2` was ALREADY implemented by prior work — `permissions.ts` has the full `PERMISSIONS` matrix + `can()`, `AuthContext.loadProfile` loads the real `role` from `public.users`, and `App.tsx RequireAccess` fail-closed redirects to `/pos`. Route table is fully guarded (settings/users/suppliers/reports/transactions/expenses/inventory/customers/dashboard/online-orders). Remaining real gaps closed now:
- **DB Export/Import/Restore/Purge** (`DatabaseTools`) had NO permission check and the component did not even read the user's role → any manager (who can open /settings) could dump the entire database (data leakage). Now gated behind `export_database` (admin-only per matrix): `handleExport`/`handleImport` early-return + buttons disabled + lock notice; **Purge Local Database** gated behind the same (admin-only).
- **Customer delete** (`CustomerManager`) unguarded → gated behind `manage_customers`.
- **Discount delete** (`DiscountManager`) unguarded → gated behind `manage_discounts`.
- **Pending sync-op delete** (`SyncQueueManager`) unguarded → gated behind admin.
- Already correctly gated (verified): Expense delete (admin), Supplier delete (admin), Sale delete/refund (`canDeleteSale`/`canRefundSale`), discount/price/stock actions in POS/Inventory.
**Offline:** enforcement works offline because `profile` + derived permission flags are cached in localStorage/localDb (RBAC is client-side, the only viable layer for anon-key single-tenant).
**Known limitation (documented):** True SERVER-SIDE RPC guards (`require_action`) were removed for `delete_sale_atomic`/`refund_sale_atomic` because they are architecturally incompatible with the anon-key deployment — they reject every call (no valid signed token) and, worse, left sales `completed` with stock unreversed (the drift we fixed earlier). Server-side authz requires real authenticated users, which is a larger migration out of scope here. Client-side RBAC + single-tenant isolation is the current enforcement boundary.

### [2026-08-18] Bill-edit traceability — link old→new invoice + "Sale Edited" label in product IN/OUT history
**Design decision:** Edit keeps the CURRENT two-phase behaviour (reverse original sale + create a NEW corrected invoice). Finalized invoices are immutable; an edit = void original + reissue corrected. This is tax/FBR-compliant and keeps a clean audit trail (the original invoice is preserved as tombstoned with its stock reversal recorded). So we did NOT change it to edit-in-place; instead we made the edit clearly traceable.
**Changes:**
- New column `sales.edited_from_invoice` (migration `20260820130000_add_edited_from_invoice.sql`, applied live; added to `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`).
- `Sale.editedFromInvoice?` field + `toRemoteSale` mapping so the corrected sale links to the original invoice (synced).
- `CheckoutPage` edit flow: sets `sale.editedFromInvoice = old invoice` and passes `{ newInvoice }` to `salesService.delete`.
- `salesService.delete`: tags the restored-stock movements with ` (Edit → #NEW)`; `salesService.create`: tags new-sale movements with ` (Edit #OLD)`. Product IN/OUT history now labels these **"Sale Edited"** (purple, IN/OUT by sign) via `ProductDetailHub`.
- `TransactionDetailModal` (eye-icon): shows a purple banner — **"Edited from #INV-XX"** (click opens the original) on the corrected bill, or **"This bill was edited → #INV-YY"** (click opens the correction) on the original.
- Verified: the edit already created correct IN/OUT records (proven by product-history screenshot: `Sale Deleted +10 IN` + `POS Sale +20 OUT` at the same timestamp). Now they are explicitly marked as an edit.

### [2026-08-18] Refund simplification — remove partial refund; only full refund + exact wallet reversal
**User directive:** "refund pe partial refund khatam karo, only refund aaye" + "wallet real rakhna, real amount, wallet na kam na ziyada".
**Change:** `RefundSaleModal` no longer offers a Partial Refund option — it is now ALWAYS a full refund
(refunds ALL remaining items, status becomes `refunded`). Removed the item-qty stepper UI, `partialQtys`,
`calculatedPartialRefund`, and the Full/Partial `SegmentedControl`. `reason` + `Refund Method` selector retained.
**Why this fixes the wallet accuracy:** `returnSale` (services.ts) for `type:'full'` reverses the wallet
(payment-mode balance) by EXACTLY `sale.total` — the real amount that was originally taken. The old partial path
used a proportional `taxRatio` and was the only source of any wallet drift; with partial gone, every refund is
full and the wallet can never end up kam (under) or ziyada (over). Final status is always `refunded`
(not `partially_refunded`), so downstream dashboards/receipts show a clean full refund.
**Note (unchanged):** the wallet reversal reverses the ORIGINAL payment method's till (standard accounting);
the chosen "Refund Method" is recorded for the audit payout only. If you instead want refund-to-Online-Wallet
to CREDIT the online wallet balance (store credit), say so and I'll switch it.

### [2026-08-18] INVENTORY INTEGRITY BUG FIX — negative item quantity flipped stock sign (+sale rows)
**Symptom (user):** product IN/OUT ledger didn't match `product.stock` (5–10 unit gap); a `POS SALE` row showed as `+5 IN` instead of `-5 OUT`.
**Root cause:** `salesService.create` stock deduction used `const qty = item.weight || item.quantity;` (services.ts:1899).
A sale item with a **negative quantity** (e.g. qty = -5, seen on INV-001030 / INV-001032 / INV-001035 during testing — those sales even had `total: -5000`)
made `newStock = stock - qty = stock + 5` AND `changeQty: -qty = +5`, flipping the sign and corrupting inventory.
**Fix:** `qty = Math.abs(Number(item.weight || item.quantity) || 0)` so a sale ALWAYS decreases stock (changeQty stays negative) regardless of input sign.
**Live data repair (jz):** flipped the 3 corrupted `sale` rows (`change_qty +5 → -5`) and reconciled both products'
`stock` to `SUM(stock_history.change_qty)`. Verified: `jeans` and `boys t shir` now both `stock = ledger = 90` with zero remaining
sign anomalies (queried all products for `sale>0` / `return<0` / `stock_in<0` → empty).
**Note:** `Math.abs` protects inventory, but a negative-quantity item would still yield a negative SALE TOTAL (revenue). Negative cart
quantities should never be creatable — if they recur, the cart/stepper must be guarded (separate fix). For now inventory can no longer drift from this.

### [2026-08-18] Wallet balances now sync across devices (checkout = reporting)
**Files:** `src/lib/cloudPull.ts`
**Context:** Checkout reads `localDb.paymentModes.balance` for the Cash/Card/Online wallet chips. That local cache was only ever updated by the device's OWN sales (`adjustPaymentBalances`) and **never pulled from the cloud**, so every device showed its own per-device balance — while Reports/Sales tab derives the true aggregate from the synced `payment_movements` ledger. (Owner report: "har device pe apna apna aa raha h".) Cloud `payment_modes.balance` is the authoritative aggregate (maintained only by the `apply_payment_movements` RPC — `adjustPaymentBalances` never pushes `payment_modes.balance`, and SyncEngine now strips `balance` from `payment_modes` upserts to prevent drift).
**Fix:** Added `payment_modes` to `cloudPull` (`PULL_DEFS` + tombstone `tableMap`) so every device pulls cloud `payment_modes` rows (balance included) on each pull cycle (15s + online/focus + realtime). Local `paymentModes.balance` now equals the cloud aggregate on all devices → checkout wallet chips match Reports/Sales tab. No schema change needed.

### [2026-08-18] payment_modes sync fix — silent drop + wallet-balance drift
**Files:** `src/lib/syncEngine.ts`
**Context:** `seedPaymentModes()` queues `queueOp('payment_modes', 'upsert'|'delete', ...)` but `payment_modes` was **missing from `tableMap`** in `executeOp`. Every such op hit `console.warn('[SyncEngine] No table mapping for entity: payment_modes')` and returned early — yet the queue still marked it done and logged `SUCCESS`, so payment-mode changes (name/icon/active) **never reached Supabase** (silent data loss across devices). Additionally `toRemotePaymentMode` pushed `balance`, which (with the mapping now fixed) would clobber the cloud's ledger-derived balance (`apply_payment_movements` is the only correct mutator per I2 wallet invariant) whenever `seedPaymentModes` re-ran with a stale local cache.
**Fix:** (1) added `payment_modes: 'payment_modes'` to `tableMap` so upsert/delete sync correctly; (2) `executeOp` now `delete payload.balance` for `payment_modes` upserts so only `apply_payment_movements` ever mutates `payment_modes.balance`. No schema change required — the `payment_modes` table + anon RLS already exist (`20260820080000_permanent_anon_compat.sql`).
**Note:** `pruneStaleOps` remains intentionally disabled (Audit Task 11) — errored ops are preserved indefinitely for manual retry, so a single lingering "pending op" in the console is expected, not a bug.

### [2026-08-18] Restore anon-key data path + fix drifted clone schemas (stock/delete/return unblocked)
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260819000000_restore_anon_compat.sql` (NEW, applied live), `supabase/migrations/20260819010000_fix_drifted_schemas.sql` (NEW, applied live), `src/lib/syncEngine.ts` (auto-background reconcile disabled — see system-guide §8), `docs/SYSTEM_FUNCTIONS_GUIDE.md`
**Context:** The 2026-08-18 hardening (`20260818140000_soft_delete_and_hardening.sql`) required `auth.uid()` (an authenticated Supabase session) for EVERY sale commit / delete / refund / stock write and narrowed RLS to `authenticated`-only. This POS ships the PUBLIC anon key and usually runs WITHOUT a supabase-auth session (offline-login fallback), so `auth.uid()` is effectively always NULL → `commit_sale` / `delete_sale_atomic` / `refund_sale_atomic` raised `FORBIDDEN`, and anon RLS blocked reads/writes. Result: **stock stopped decreasing, deletes/returns never reversed stock, deleted sales stopped syncing**. `20260819000000_restore_anon_compat.sql` reverts the anon-key path (keeps idempotency + soft-delete tombstone + over-refund cap) and re-adds permissive anon+authenticated RLS/grants. Additionally minimahal & pizzamilano were behind the master schema (their migrations never ran): missing `sales.idempotency_key` column (broke `commit_sale` INSERT) and `sales_status_check` lacked `'deleted'`/`'cancelled'` (broke `delete_sale_atomic`). `20260819010000_fix_drifted_schemas.sql` adds the column (IF NOT EXISTS) and aligns the constraint. **Auto-background `reconcileAllStock(true)` was removed from `syncEngine.startSyncEngine`** — it force-reset `products.stock` to a stale ledger snapshot on every app load/refresh, erasing legitimate sale/delete stock movements (reconcile is now MANUAL-only via the purple button).
**Applied live:** jeanzone, minimahal, pizzamilano 2026-08-18. Verified end-to-end (sale→stock↓, return/delete→stock↑ with `stock_history` rows type=`sale`/=`return`) on all three via the real RPCs. atonline: no mgmt key in env_backups — code pushed but DB not yet patched.

### [2026-08-18] apply_payment_movements uuid bug — Sale Delete Abort Fix
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260818160000_fix_apply_payment_movements_uuid.sql` (NEW), `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`
**Context (sync round-4):** `apply_payment_movements` used `uuid_generate_v4()` but the function sets `SET search_path TO 'public'` — `uuid_generate_v4` lives in the `uuid-ossp` schema, so it was invisible → every real payment movement returned **404** (masked SQLSTATE 42883 `function uuid_generate_v4() does not exist`). `adjustPaymentBalances` calls this RPC during a sale **delete** and was NOT in a try/catch → threw → `localDb.sales.delete(id)` never ran → cloud sale remained → `cloudPull` re-pulled it back ("delet ni hote wapis aa jate hain"). `apply_stock_movements` already used built-in `gen_random_uuid()` (always visible) and worked. Fix: `uuid_generate_v4()` → `gen_random_uuid()` (verified live: real payload now executes instead of 404ing). This also unblocks all app-originated wallet/payment-movement syncs (sales, refunds, expenses) that were silently 404ing.
**Applied live:** jeanzone 2026-08-18 (CREATE OR REPLACE via Management API). New migration replays the fix on remaining clone projects on next deploy.

### [2026-08-18] sales(created_at) Index — Full-Pull Timeout Fix
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260818150000_sales_created_at_index.sql` (NEW, applied live), `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `src/lib/services.ts`, `src/lib/cloudPull.ts`, `src/lib/syncEngine.ts`
**Context (sync round-3):**
1. **Full-pull statement timeout (57014):** sales = 45MB (items jsonb ~35KB/row, 1266 rows). Initial cache load (`salesService.fetchRemote`) + cloudPull epoch pull fetched 1000-row pages = ~35MB per single response → PostgREST `statement_timeout` (8s) → `canceling statement due to statement timeout` → "Sync Failed" + local cache never fully loads. Fix: sales pulls now paginate in **200-row pages** (both fetchRemote and cloudPull), plus `CREATE INDEX idx_sales_created_at ON sales (created_at DESC)` for the `order by created_at desc` sort.
2. **`localDb.queueOp is not a function` (TypeError, delete broken):** syncEngine.ts:1014 called `localDb.queueOp(...)` on the Dexie instance — `queueOp` is a standalone export, so the canceled-order prune (24h) threw and the delete never queued. Now imports + calls `queueOp(...)` directly.
**Applied live:** jeanzone 2026-08-18 (index created via Management API). Push to remaining clone projects on next deploy.

### [2026-08-18] Soft-Delete + Fail-Closed Commit + Grants Narrowing + RLS Hardening + Oversell Lock Fix
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260818140000_soft_delete_and_hardening.sql` (NEW, applied live), `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `src/lib/cloudPull.ts`, `src/lib/syncEngine.ts`, `src/context/SupabaseAppContext.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
**Context (MASTER round 2):**
1. **§0.6/§8 soft delete:** `delete_sale_atomic` NEVER destroys the historical sale row — now `UPDATE sales SET status='deleted', deleted_at=now()` + `row_tombstones` upsert (`ON CONFLICT (table_name, ref_id) DO UPDATE`). Double-delete is idempotent (`already_deleted`). `syncEngine` sales delete ops now call this RPC (not REST DELETE); `cloudPull` filters `.is('deleted_at', null)` so soft-deleted sales never re-surface; force-pull applies tombstones.
2. **§2.1.4 fail-closed commit_sale:** missing `users` row (NULL role) is REJECTED (`42501`), never silently allowed. Roles: admin|manager|cashier|salesman.
3. **§12 oversell guard — REAL ROOT CAUSE FIX (live-tested):** inline `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` inside an INVOKER plpgsql function on an RLS table **silently returns 0 rows for non-owner roles** (plain SELECT works; any locking clause returns nothing — reproduced at core SQL level for cashier AND admin). The guard therefore NEVER fired. Fix: new `lock_product_stock(pid)` SECURITY DEFINER helper takes the row lock in the CALLER's transaction (owner context). Race test (2 concurrent commit_sale on last unit, stock=1): exactly ONE succeeds, other gets `OVERSELL (P0003)`, stock ends 0, exactly 1 sale row. Sequential oversell also verified. EXECUTE restricted to `authenticated` (revoked from anon/public).
4. **§2.1.4 anon grants narrowed:** `REVOKE ALL ON ALL TABLES` → `GRANT SELECT` on all + `GRANT INSERT ON customers, store_orders` (public estore) + sequences; `REVOKE ALL ON ALL FUNCTIONS` + re-grant EXECUTE. `row_tombstones` anon policy → SELECT only.
5. **§2.1.4 RLS hardening:** per-command policies on products (SELECT public / write admin+manager), sales (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE authenticated, **NO DELETE policy** — delete only via guarded RPC), customers (SELECT public, INSERT public, write admin+manager), app_settings (old FOR-public write policies REPLACED — write admin+manager), expenses/suppliers/supplier_transactions (SELECT authenticated, write admin+manager). Derived-value triggers → SECURITY DEFINER: `trigger_update_product_stock`, `trigger_update_variant_stock`, `update_customer_stats`, `generate_invoice_number`, `get_next_invoice_number` (else cashier checkout breaks under RLS).
6. **Force-sync UI fixes:** Header force-sync modal never closed (sonner.loading = MODAL, success = toast — now `sonner.close()` after sync), 45s timeout via `Promise.race`, offline guard (no fake "synced" toast — warning instead); `forceSync` rework: clears syncHistory → `waitForPullIdle(30000)` → `resetLastPullTime()` → `pullCloudChanges(true)` → `handleCloudPullChanged` → finally loading=false (removed slow legacy `loadData(false,true)`).
7. **Tombstone pull bug fix:** `row_tombstones` has NO `created_at` column — pull previously filtered `gte('created_at')` so tombstones NEVER applied. Now uses `deleted_at`.
**Live verification (jeanzone, 2026-08-18):** live RPC defs verified (has_lock, fail_closed, soft_delete); §2.1.5 rejected-API matrix PASS (cashier PATCH products/customers/expenses/app_settings = 0 rows blocked; cashier sales DELETE = 0 rows; cashier delete_sale_atomic = 403; cashier users role change = 403; anon delete_sale_atomic = 401; anon sales INSERT = 401; anon customers INSERT = 201 allowed; cashier suppliers INSERT = 403; over-refund = 403 `FORBIDDEN: refund amount exceeds sale total`; refund of deleted sale = `STALE_WRITE` P0007); idempotency PASS (same idempotency_key → `already_committed`; double delete → `already_deleted`); legit partial refund restores stock via trigger; `get_next_invoice_number` as cashier = 200 (SECURITY DEFINER under RLS). All test data/users cleaned up.
**Applied live:** jeanzone 2026-08-18. Push to remaining clone projects on next deploy.

### [2026-08-18] Cross-Device Pull Engine + Login Expiry 24h + Wallet Backfill + Users RLS
**Files:** `src/lib/cloudPull.ts` (NEW), `src/context/SupabaseAppContext.tsx`, `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`, `src/lib/services.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260818120000_cloud_pull_and_hardening.sql`, `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`
**Context:** (1) System was PUSH-ONLY — no cloud→local pull existed, so devices never showed each other's changes even after refresh. New `cloudPull.ts` engine pulls deltas every 15s + on online/focus + Supabase Realtime (best-effort) + tombstone-driven deletes + user-block detection; AppContext refreshes React state on change; Header Force Sync now does a full cursor-reset pull. (2) GEMINI rule "session expiry MUST be exactly 24 hours" was violated by code (7-day/5AM) — now exactly 24h from `pos_session_start`, refreshed on every login. (3) Wallet ledger was empty (only 15 rows vs 1265 completed sales) — `backfill_payment_movements()` RPC reconstructed 1280 ledger rows from `sales.split_payments` + expenses, balances recomputed from ledger (I2 parity = 0 mismatches). (4) Expense create/update/delete now write `payment_movements` (was missing). (5) Users RLS + role-escalation guard trigger (anon role rewrite blocked). (6) `variant_stock_history` idempotency index. (7) `process_return` idempotency fix (SET cumulative, was += double-post). (8) `apply_stock_movements`/`apply_payment_movements` role guards. (9) anon grants narrowed to SELECT-only (writes need JWT). (10) Realtime REPLICA IDENTITY FULL on all core tables.
**Live verification (jeanzone):** I1=0, I2=0, I6=0, invariant_violations=0, stock_mismatches=0, duplicate movements=0, post-repair new data=0 mismatches, backfill inserted=1280. I4 raw mismatches are ALL historical artifacts (deleted products / empty-item bill-edit sales) — 0 real mismatches on existing tracked products. I5 8 rows are negative-total bill-edit artifacts (refunded_amount=0, no ledger impact).
**Applied live:** jeanzone 2026-08-18 (migration + backfill). Push to remaining clone projects on next deploy.

### [2026-08-18] RESTORE ANON-KEY DATA PATH (reverses 20260818140000 / 20260818100000 / 20260818010000 hardening)
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260819000000_restore_anon_compat.sql` (NEW, applied live), `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`
**Context — WHY this reversal was necessary:** The 2026-08-18 hardening (commit_sale_role_check + soft_delete_and_hardening + rpc_role_guards) required `auth.uid()` (an authenticated Supabase session) for EVERY sale commit, stock write, delete and refund, and narrowed RLS to `authenticated`-only. BUT this POS ships the **public anon key** in the browser bundle and the app frequently operates WITHOUT a Supabase-auth session — `AuthContext.signIn` tries `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` but the app's `users`-table password rarely matches the separate `supabase auth.users` password, so it falls back to the **offline-login path** (no Supabase session). Result: `auth.uid()` is effectively always NULL for the data client. Impact (verified in live DB): cloud sales collapsed from ~20/day (Aug 11-15) to ~1-8/day (Aug 17-18); `products`/`sales` RLS blocked the anon client so the laptop's `fetchRemote` returned 0 sales; stock stopped decreasing (no cloud `stock_history`); deletes stopped syncing.
**Fix:** Removed the `auth.uid()` / role `FORBIDDEN` guards from `commit_sale`, `delete_sale_atomic`, `refund_sale_atomic`, `apply_payment_movements` (kept idempotency, soft-delete+tombstone, over-refund cap). Re-added permissive `anon, authenticated` RLS policies + table/sequence/function grants on all synced tables so the browser anon-key client can read AND write. This restores the pre-2026-08-18 working behaviour that the app's actual auth model requires.
**Live verification (genmpxcnmdcfwwymjibd, 2026-08-18):** `commit_sale` called as **anon** returned `{"success": true}` (no FORBIDDEN); product stock decreased 999985→999980 on a real movement; `delete_sale_atomic` as anon returned `{"success": true}` and reversed stock 999980→999985 + set `status='deleted'`; anon `SELECT` on `sales`/`products` now returns rows. NOTE: MASTER §2.1.4 role enforcement is intentionally dropped here because it is unenforceable in this anon-key single-tenant architecture — if true per-user auth is later required, the correct fix is to make `AuthContext.signIn` establish a real Supabase session (sync `users`-table passwords to `auth.users`), NOT to gate RPCs on `auth.uid()`.
**Applied live:** genmpxcnmdcfwwymjibd 2026-08-18. Push to remaining clone projects on next deploy.
**DATA CORRUPTION FOUND:** product `Kids Shorts Summer` shows stock = **-111** (negative) — the earlier broken sync (retry storms + the `pe.queueOp is not a function` bug) over-applied stock movements. Run `audit_stock_integrity_history()` + a stock reconciliation after this fix lands.

### [2026-08-18] NEW PROJECT FRESH-INSTALL SCHEMA FIXES (search_path + index ordering)
**Files:** `supabase/schema/SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `src/components/dashboard/DashboardManager.tsx`
**Context:** A brand-new Supabase project created via Management API failed to apply the master schema / run RPCs. Two root causes found on fresh projects (do NOT affect the existing clones, which had pgcrypto in `public`):
1. **`SET search_path` quoted-form bug:** all functions used `SET search_path = 'public, extensions'` / `SET search_path TO 'public, extensions'` (QUOTED). On new Supabase projects pgcrypto/uuid-ossp install into the `extensions` schema, and the QUOTED `'public, extensions'` string was mis-parsed so `public` tables were NOT resolved inside SECURITY DEFINER functions → `verify_table_write`/`verify_action_token` threw `relation "users" does not exist`, and `digest()` (pgcrypto) threw `function digest(text, unknown) does not exist` → every suppliers/guard write 404'd. Fixed: changed to **UNQUOTED** `SET search_path = public, extensions` / `SET search_path TO public, extensions` (comma-separated list). Verified `verify_table_write()` now resolves both `public.users` and `extensions.digest`.
2. **`idx_sales_source_order_id` ordering:** the partial UNIQUE index on `sales(source_order_id)` was created in the commit_sale idempotency block BEFORE the column was added (post-launch `ALTER TABLE sales ADD COLUMN source_order_id`). On a fresh DB this 42703'd. Moved the index creation into the POST-LAUNCH ALTER block (right after the column ADD) using `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` (idempotent).
3. **Defensive:** qualified `products`/`stock_history`/`sales` with `public.` inside the two LANGUAGE-sql audit functions so CREATE-time body validation never depends on search_path.
**Code fix:** `DashboardManager.tsx` referenced `localDb` (Line 43) without importing it → `ReferenceError: localDb is not defined` crashed the dashboard. Added `import { localDb } from '../../lib/localDb';`.
**Applied live:** 2026-08-18 (full `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql` re-pushed + app build green). These master-schema edits are idempotent and safe to re-push to all clones on next deploy (no behaviour change on old projects where pgcrypto is in `public`).

### [2026-08-18] Fresh clone — apply anon-permissive RLS (restore_anon_compat) after master schema push
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260819001001_clone_anon_permissive.sql` (NEW, applied live)
**Context:** After the fresh-install fixes, suppliers sync still failed with `new row violates row-level security policy for table "suppliers"` (403). Root cause: the master schema's `*_all` permissive policies are **SELECT-only** (lines 3830-3835 of `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`), while INSERT/UPDATE are gated by `*_write_guard`/`*_update_guard` calling `verify_table_write(...)` (MASTER §2.1.4 signed-token). On existing clones this was fixed by `20260819000000_restore_anon_compat.sql`, which adds `FOR ALL ... WITH CHECK (true)` permissive policies for `anon, authenticated`. That migration FAILED to apply on a fresh clone because the master schema had already created `expenses_all`/`suppliers_all`/`app_settings_all` (SELECT-only, same names) → `policy already exists`. The §2.1.4 token path is unenforceable anyway (anon-key single-tenant, `auth.uid()` always NULL) so the working clones already run with it disabled.
**Fix:** `20260819001001_clone_anon_permissive.sql` DROPs each existing `*_all` (SELECT-only) policy then re-CREATEs it `FOR ALL TO anon, authenticated USING (true) WITH CHECK (true)` on all 12 synced tables (products, sales, customers, expenses, suppliers, supplier_transactions, app_settings, stock_history, variant_stock_history, payment_movements, payment_modes, row_tombstones), plus re-grants tables/sequences/functions to `anon`+`authenticated`. Also re-applied the 4 function replacements (`commit_sale`, `delete_sale_atomic`, `refund_sale_atomic`, `apply_payment_movements`) from `20260819000000_restore_anon_compat.sql` to remove any `auth.uid()` guards.
**Live verification:** `SET ROLE anon; INSERT INTO suppliers (...) RETURNING id` → returned a UUID (RLS insert now allowed). `pg_policies` confirms `suppliers_all`/`expenses_all`/`app_settings_all` are now `cmd=All, roles={anon,authenticated}, with_check=true`. Suppliers (and all guarded-table) sync now succeeds on the fresh clone.

> ⚠️ **CLONE RULE:** Every NEW clone created from `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql` MUST run `20260819000000_restore_anon_compat.sql` (or the idempotent `20260819001001_clone_anon_permissive.sql` if the master's SELECT-only `*_all` policies already exist) — otherwise anon-key writes (suppliers/expenses/app_settings/etc.) are blocked by the §2.1.4 guards. Do NOT hardcode any specific project ref here; this applies to ALL clones.

### [2026-08-15] Add Missing store_orders updated_at Trigger
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260815152500_add_store_orders_updated_at_trigger.sql`, `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`
**Context:** The `update_updated_at_column` trigger was missing for `store_orders` in the schema, which is required for the F21 stale-write guard pattern. Added the trigger to complete the guard pattern.

### [2026-08-16] Atomic Delete/Refund RPCs + SyncEngine Self-Heal + Audit Accuracy Fixes
**Files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260816010000_atomic_delete_refund_rpc.sql` (+ appended to `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`) — new `delete_sale_atomic(p_sale_id, p_history)` and `refund_sale_atomic(p_sale_id, p_history, p_status, p_refunded_amount)` RPCs. Stock reversal + sale mutation in ONE tx (idempotent via ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING + EXISTS guards). Deployed jeanzone + minimahal.
- `supabase/migrations/20260816020000_role_narrowing.sql` (+ `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `types/index.ts`) — role CHECK narrowed to `(cashier, salesman)`; `handle_new_user` first-user no longer auto-admin; legacy rows migrated. Deployed jeanzone + minimahal. TS `User.role` is now `'cashier' | 'salesman'`.
- `src/lib/services.ts` — `deleteSaleAtomic`/`refundSaleAtomic` wrappers; `salesService.delete` now atomic (adds `partially_refunded` to stock-restore guard → fixes leak); `returnSale` atomic + re-entrancy mutex (`activeReturns`) + `status==='refunded'` no-op; `reconcileAllStock` now audits+fixes BOTH scalar `stock_history` AND `variant_stock_history`/variant_data (F22); `productsService.update` strips stock (scalar+variant) so generic updates can't desync the ledger.
- `src/lib/syncEngine.ts` — invoice-collision recovery fixed (`data` is scalar TEXT, not `data.invoiceNumber` → previously silently dropped colliding sales); `reconcileStuckOps()` self-heal re-queues exhausted ops every 15 min; boot `reconcileAllStock(false)` (report-only, no silent offline-stock erasure).
- `src/lib/localDb.ts` — `isPendingChange()` helper (mirrors `isPendingDelete`).
- `src/context/SupabaseAppContext.tsx` — products realtime UPDATE no longer clobbers a locally-pending edit.
- `src/components/reports/ReportsManager.tsx` — report cache TTL 30s→10s + window-focus/visibility force-refresh.
- `src/components/users/UserModal.tsx` — removed unused `createClient` import.
**Context:** Deep audit confirmed 4 real gaps (CRITICAL #1 partial-refund delete leak, CRITICAL #2 dead invoice-collision recovery, HIGH #3 variant ledger ignored by reconcile, HIGH #4 returnSale re-entrancy) plus boot autoFix data-loss + role-DB gap + products.update stock footgun. All fixed. Self-heal guarantees no op is ever permanently stuck.
**Remaining (deferred, non-corruption):** #6 local↔cloud reconcile compare; #8 `device_id` column; #10 schema dedup; #12 online-order reservation; #14 `product_batches` removal; #7 `adminSupabase` service_role client needs server-side refactor (route blocked, currently null-guarded).

### [2026-08-12] Full-Project Audit Fixes — F12-F20 + Universal Branding
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260812215000_estore_cancel_double_release_guard.sql`, `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `src/lib/services.ts`, `src/lib/syncEngine.ts`, `src/lib/localDb.ts`, `src/context/SupabaseAppContext.tsx`, `src/components/reports/ReportsManager.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/DashboardManager.tsx`, `src/components/transactions/TransactionsManager.tsx`, `src/components/transactions/RefundSaleModal.tsx`, `src/components/inventory/PurchaseHistory.tsx`, `src/components/pos/POSTerminal.tsx`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `docs/setup.md`
**Context:** 3 parallel audits (stock ledger integrity, sync engine, money math) found 15 issues — all fixed. Universal rules F12-F20 written into AGENTS.md + GEMINI.md.
**Fixes:**
1. **C1 (CRITICAL):** PurchaseHistory delete double-reversal (−2×Q on cloud) — handler no longer reverses; `purchaseRecordsService.delete` now reverses ALL record types (incl. Adjustment, signed quantity) with ONE `adjustment_out` entry.
2. **H1/B1:** `partially_refunded` double-count in ReportsManager revenue/wallets — merge by sale id (sales copy wins).
3. **B2:** Credit Collected + collections exclude refund payouts (`direction:'out'`).
4. **A1:** `getReportExpenses` paginated via `fetchAllPages` (was capped at 1000).
5. **H3:** Drafts = `status:'pending'` — create/delete skip all stock/customer effects; `getReportSales` filters `.neq('status','pending')`.
6. **H4:** ADD_SALE reducer skips estore fulfillment sales (sourceOrderId).
7. **H5/H6:** queueOp merge — delete survives update/upsert; merge resets `retries:0`.
8. **H7:** payments delta fetch failure = identity no-op (no local ledger wipe).
9. **B3:** RefundSaleModal 2dp rounding.
10. **B5/B6:** Dashboard + Transactions wallet totals match Reports definition (credit excluded, refunds per method).
11. **A2:** state.sales 1000-cap removed (never truncate financial data).
12. **A3:** cloud sales search paginated; `fetchAllPages` exported.
13. **F20:** constraint errors mark ops `error` (never delete); sync timeout no longer releases `_isSyncing` mid-batch.
14. **F18:** sales UPDATE realtime skips pending-delete rows; realtime `stock_history` rows mapped.
15. **DB:** estore cancel trigger releases stock only when `fulfilled_sale_id IS NULL` (migration 20260812215000) — deployed to all 4 projects.
16. **Universal branding:** all vendor branding removed from code (tenant name from settings, neutral `POS` fallback). Persistence keys preserved (`ZaynahsPosDB_`, `Zaynahs_Local_Backups_DB`, `zaynahs-pos-auth`, logo asset).

### [2026-08-12] Permanent Fixes — F21 Stale-Write Guards + F22 Variant-Restock Ledger
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260812180000_stale_write_guards_variant_restock.sql`, `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `src/lib/syncEngine.ts`, `src/lib/services.ts`, `src/lib/stockInCommit.ts`, `src/components/inventory/BatchStockInSystem.tsx`, `src/components/inventory/ProductDetailHub.tsx`, `src/types/index.ts`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `docs/setup.md`
**Context:** The last two known limitations were made PERMANENT solutions: (1) cross-device stale writes could resurrect deleted ledger rows (last-write-wins), (2) variant stock never updated on restock.
**Fixes:**
1. **F21 (DB, server-enforced):** `row_tombstones` registry + `record_row_tombstone()` AFTER DELETE + `guard_stale_write()` BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE raising `STALE_WRITE` (P0007) on `sales`, `stock_history`, `variant_stock_history`, `purchase_records`, `expenses`, `payments`, `store_orders`, `sales_tabs`. Deleted financial rows can NEVER resurrect; newest-wins replaces last-write-wins. `update_updated_at_column()` now preserves client timestamps when newer.
2. **F21 (SyncEngine):** P0007/stale_write error → op dropped (by-definition-outdated payload; retry impossible) + local refreshes via realtime/merge (cloud = truth). NOT applied to products/customers/suppliers (variation child id reuse; they keep client-side skip).
3. **F22:** `purchase_records.variant_id`/`variant_label` columns; `purchaseRecordsService.create` writes ONE `purchase` variant_stock_history entry (+qty) + local variantData update via shared `applyVariantStockMovement()`; `delete` reverses with ONE `adjustment` entry (−qty). `commitStockInToInventory` (shared path) + BatchStockInSystem (refactored onto the shared helper, variant selector column added) + ProductDetailHub quick-restock all support variant-targeted restock.
4. **F22:** ProductDetailHub direct variant-stock field edits log `adjustment` delta entries (previously silently stripped from product payloads and LOST).
5. **Schema docs:** master schema + setup.md updated; deploy = full master schema push via Management API to all 4 projects (also covers NEW clones — schema is idempotent, a new clone auto-installs all guards by pushing `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`).

### [2026-08-12] System Functions Guide + F23 Registration Rule
**Files:** `docs/SYSTEM_FUNCTIONS_GUIDE.md` (new), `GEMINI.md` (RULE F23), `AGENTS.md` (reference + F23)
**Context:** User asked for a permanent detailed guide so future agents can understand the full system flow (every DB function, trigger, financial flow) without re-researching, plus a mandatory rule that every new function follows the same guard pattern and registers itself in the guide.
**Added:**
1. **Guide:** `docs/SYSTEM_FUNCTIONS_GUIDE.md` — layer map (app vs Supabase), full §2 registry of ALL 9 DB functions/triggers (verified live 24 guards/7 functions/2 stock triggers × 4 projects), F21 stale-write flow diagram, F22 variant-restock flow diagram, sync/recovery flow, §6 MANDATORY checklist for adding new financial tables/functions (3 triggers + ledger + shared helper + localDb/sync + register + test), §7 ready-to-run TEST BATTERY (A schema inventory, B live guard battery, C variant ledger live, D residue check), §8 troubleshooting cheatsheet.
2. **RULE F23 (GEMINI.md):** guide = live source of truth; every new financial table/function MUST follow the guard pattern; register in guide §2 + SCHEMA CHANGE LOG + run battery on ALL 4 projects (expected: `f21_guards=24`, `tombstones=1`, `functions=7`); NEVER add a financial write path without guards.
3. **AGENTS.md:** F23 listed in AUDIT-GRADE RULES + guide added to Reference Docs table.

### [2026-08-12] TESTS_GUIDE full-flow battery — Estore + Schema Parity fixes
**Files:** `docs/TESTS_GUIDE.md` (new), `supabase/migrations/20260812235500_fix_estore_place_order_bugs.sql`, `supabase/migrations/20260813000000_fix_products_variant_history_schema_parity.sql`, `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `docs/SYSTEM_FUNCTIONS_GUIDE.md`, `docs/setup.md`
**Context:** User asked for a complete test guide + full system flow test (products all types, billing, estore, orders→POS, reports) — and to delete all test records after. Battery found 3 real DB issues, all fixed + verified on all 4 projects, then **zero residue cleanup**.
**Fixes (all deployed to 4 projects via Management API, verified):**
1. **ESTORE ORDERING TOTALLY BROKEN (all projects):** `place_estore_order` wrote to non-existent `address`/`table_number`/`fulfillment_mode` columns + cast UUID `reference_id`→`::text` → every online order + every cancel failed. Rewrote: `delivery_address` (jo app bhejta hai), UUID refs, **F22 variant-aware reservation/release** (variant items reserve via `variant_stock_history`). Retest: reserve −2, variant reserve −2, cancel +2, fulfil→sale — 4/4 PASS.
2. **MINIMAHAL products schema divergence:** `product_type`, `is_service`, `require_serial`, `is_weight_based`, `price_per_unit`, `unit`, `parent_id` columns missing (master schema post-launch ALTER block omitted them; v16 CREATE-only). Added idempotently → variable products now save there.
3. **PIZZAMILANO variant_stock_history CHECK divergence:** type list lacked `'purchase'` (+ signed types) → variant stock-in crashed there. Normalized to 7-type set on all projects.
**After fixes:** full system-flow battery **11/11 PASS identical on all 4 projects** (products simple+variable, stock_in +10, variant stock_in +3, sale deduct, draft no-deduct, stale edit P0007, delete restore once, tombstone resurrect block, estore reserve/variant/cancel, fulfil-link). Cleanup: **residue 0/0/0/0** (products/sales/orders/history/tombstones all test rows deleted).

### [2026-08-12] docs/setup.md — MAJOR RULES section (7 non-negotiable rules)
**Files:** `docs/setup.md` (Core Principles + new ⚠️ MAJOR RULES section + TOC update)
**Context:** User requested the universal operating rules documented in setup.md so every session/agent follows them without ambiguity.
**Added:** Table of 7 non-negotiable rules — (1) Code = UNIVERSAL (1 codebase, sab 4 repos, no brand hardcode), (2) Env/Credentials always from `env_backups/` (har shop ka apna file — kabhi guess/mix nahi), (3) All fixes applied to ALL projects + deploy verify mandatory (no verify = no "done"), (4) Code 1 — credentials ALAG-ALAG (har shop apna env/CF token), (5) Master Schema = SAME parity on all 4 projects (SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql single source), (6) Systems IDENTICAL on all projects (test battery results identical: `f21_guards=24`/`tombstones=1`/`functions=7`, divergence = fix), (7) Docs current (SYSTEM_FUNCTIONS_GUIDE/MODULES/UI_RULES/GEMINI/setup.md update in same change).

### [2026-08-12] Financial Integrity Sweep — Trigger Model Completion + Reconcile Restore
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260812142314_get_next_invoice_number_rpc.sql`, `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `src/lib/services.ts`, `src/lib/syncEngine.ts`, `src/lib/localDb.ts`, `src/context/SupabaseAppContext.tsx`, `src/components/inventory/InventoryManager.tsx`, `src/components/inventory/ProductDetailHub.tsx`, `src/components/inventory/PurchaseHistory.tsx`, `GEMINI.md`
**Context:** Cloud triggers `on_stock_history_insert` + `on_variant_stock_history_insert` were added earlier (08-12) to make stock single-source via the append-only stock_history ledger. This sweep fixed every remaining path that still sent ABSOLUTE stock in `products` payloads (double-count with the trigger), restored the F11 reconcile tool, and hardened sync data-loss paths.
**Fixes:**
1. **Non-atomic product payloads — stock stripped everywhere** (cloud stock is now ONLY via history trigger):
   - `salesService.delete` main + addon restores (`services.ts`), refund addon restore, `productsService.adjustStock`, `purchaseRecordsService.create` cost payload, `productsService.create` (only when an `initial` history entry exists — non-tracked 999999 stock keeps absolute value), `PurchaseHistory` delete reversal.
   - Kept absolute stock ONLY for non-tracked products (no history entry → no trigger → absolute value required).
2. **Variant stock restore on delete/refund:** `salesService.delete` + `returnSale` now write `variant_stock_history` 'return' entries + restore local `variant_data` (previously variant levels stayed permanently low after delete/refund).
3. **Direct stock edit audit:** `ProductDetailHub.handleSave` now logs `adjustment` history when the stock field is edited directly (was silent before).
4. **Reconcile tool restored (RULE F11):** `reconcileAllStock(autoFix?)` in `services.ts` — replays cloud `stock_history` ledger (Σ change_qty per product), compares with `products.stock`, reports mismatches, auto-fix writes one `adjustment` history entry per mismatch (trigger aligns stock). Purple "Reconcile" button with Shield icon added to InventoryManager toolbar.
5. **Sync data-loss hardening:**
   - `pruneStaleOps` now ONLY prunes errored ops (never pending — unsynced bills are financial records).
   - `queueOp` cap no longer drops pending ops — prunes errored ones instead, or warns.
   - `pruneExpiredCancelledOrders` REMOTE DELETE REMOVED — cancelled orders are permanent financial records; cloud audit trail preserved (local cache still cleaned).
6. **Invoice collision RPC added:** `get_next_invoice_number()` now exists (was missing → collision retries always failed). Deployed to all 4 projects.
7. **Report truncation fixed:** `getReportSales` + `getReportRefunds` + `salesService.searchSales` + `salesService.fetchRemote` + `storeOrdersService.fetchRemote` now paginate via `fetchAllPages` (no more 200/5000 caps — big-shop totals accurate).
8. **Fixed pre-existing build error:** duplicate `costUpdate` declaration in `purchaseRecordsService.create`.
9. **AppContext realtime sale reducer** no longer floors stock at 0 (matches ledger negative values).

### [2026-07-31] Fix: Add updated_at to 5 ledger/history tables (Delta Sync 400s)
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260731210000_add_updated_at_ledger_history_tables.sql`, `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `docs/setup.md`, `GEMINI.md`
**Issue:** Delta sync queries `updated_at=gte.X` on `supplier_transactions`, `payments`, `stock_history`, `variant_stock_history`, `product_addons` — but these tables only had `created_at`. Supabase REST returned **400 (Bad Request)**; code fell back to full-table fetches every sync ("[stockHistory] Delta sync failed, fetching all").
**Fixes:**
1. **Schema Migration:** Added `updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL` to all 5 tables (ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS) + `update_*_updated_at` triggers via existing `update_updated_at_column()` function + backfill `updated_at = created_at` for existing rows.
2. **Master Schema:** Added `updated_at` to both CREATE TABLE blocks (incl. duplicate block copies) AND post-launch ALTER TABLE + trigger block in `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`.
3. **Docs:** `docs/setup.md` table rows 15–17 updated.
4. **No code change needed** — services.ts already has the correct `updated_at` delta query; the fallback catch will simply never trigger now.

### [2026-07-24] Fix: App Settings Singleton Reset Bug (Multiple DB Rows)
**Files:** `services.ts`, `GEMINI.md`
**Issue:** `app_settings` is a singleton table and must only have one row (`id = 00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001`). However, Supabase contained 7 extra garbage rows with random UUIDs. `settingsService.fetchRemote()` was doing `select('*')` without an order and picking `data[0]`. This caused it to randomly pick a garbage row containing default settings (Dark mode, 4 columns), which would overwrite local state and cause settings to "reset" across all devices on page refresh.
**Fixes:**
1. **Database Cleanup:** Executed a Supabase API DELETE command to remove all rows where `id != 00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001`.
2. **Code Hardening:** Modified `settingsService.fetchRemote()` in `src/lib/services.ts` to strictly query `.eq('id', SETTINGS_ID)`. This ensures that even if garbage rows are accidentally created in the future, the app will ALWAYS fetch the correct singleton row.

### [2026-07-23] Full-System Re-Audit v2: Ledger Separation, Manual Override, Soft-Delete, Suppliers Report
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260723120000_ledger_separation_manual_override.sql`, `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `types/index.ts`, `services.ts`, `BatchStockInSystem.tsx`, `PurchaseOrderSystem.tsx`, `SupplierLedger.tsx`, `CustomerDetailModal.tsx`, `ExpenseModal.tsx`, `SuppliersReport.tsx` (NEW), `ReportsManager.tsx`, `GEMINI.md`
**Changes:**
1. **Schema Migration:** Adds `source_type TEXT`, `is_manual_override BOOLEAN`, `override_by TEXT` to `supplier_transactions`. Adds `is_manual_override`, `override_by` to `payments` and `expenses`. Adds `deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ` to `sales`. Backfills existing entries.
2. **Master Schema:** Added to both CREATE TABLE and post-launch ALTER TABLE blocks in `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`.
3. **Types:** Added `sourceType`, `isManualOverride`, `overrideBy` to `SupplierTransaction`, `Payment`, `Expense` interfaces.
4. **Services:** `toRemoteSupplierTransaction` maps 3 new fields; `recordBill` accepts `sourceType`; `recordPayment` accepts override flags; `getLedger` exposes `sourceType`; `bulkUpdate` logs per-product price-change history via stock_history; `salesService.delete` converted from hard-delete to soft-delete (status='deleted').
5. **BatchStockInSystem + PurchaseOrderSystem:** Added "Record as Supplier Bill" toggle (default ON), passes `sourceType: 'auto_purchase'`.
6. **SupplierLedger:** Color-coded badges (AUTO-PURCHASE blue, MANUAL BILL red, PAYMENT green, OPENING violet), manual override toggles in payment + bill modals.
7. **CustomerDetailModal + ExpenseModal:** Manual override toggle added to payment/expense forms.
8. **SuppliersReport (NEW):** Full supplier report tab with summary cards, sortable table, expandable per-supplier ledger, source badges, CSV export, mobile responsive.
9. **ReportsManager:** Added 'suppliers' tab with Truck icon (amber color).

### [2026-07-17] Add Custom Badge System to Bundles (Color, Text, Icon, Enable/Disable)
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260717170000_add_badge_columns.sql`, `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `types/index.ts`, `services.ts`, `BundleManager.tsx`, `HighlightBadge.tsx`, `StoreFront.tsx`, `GEMINI.md`
**Changes:**
1. **Schema Migration:** Adds `badge_enabled BOOLEAN`, `badge_text TEXT`, `badge_icon TEXT`, `badge_bg_color TEXT`, `badge_text_color TEXT` to `bundles` table. Backfills Crown Crust deals with enabled=true, text='CROWN', icon='crown', bg='#1A1A1A', text='#D4AF37'.
2. **Master Schema:** Added to both `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bundles` and post-launch `ALTER TABLE` blocks.
3. **Types:** Added `badgeEnabled`, `badgeText`, `badgeIcon`, `badgeBgColor`, `badgeTextColor` to `Bundle` interface.
4. **Services:** `mapBundle` maps badge fields; `create`/`update` persist badge fields to Supabase + localDb.
5. **BundleManager.tsx:** Added "Badge" section in edit form after Pricing Mode with enable toggle, text input, 8-icon picker, 6 bg-color swatches + color picker, 4 text-color swatches + color picker, and live preview.

7. **StoreFront.tsx:** Bundle cards now render badge via new dynamic system when `badgeEnabled=true`, falling back to legacy `highlightTag`.

### [2026-07-15] FIX: Add missing estore columns to ALTER TABLE in SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA
**Issue:** `estore_theme_color`, `estore_delivery_fee`, `estore_min_order`, `estore_cod_enabled` were only in `CREATE TABLE` block (lines 275-278) but NOT in any `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`. Existing DBs never got them.
**Fix:** Added all 4 columns to the post-launch `ALTER TABLE app_settings` block in `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`.

6. **StoreFront.tsx + ProductGrid.tsx:** If `overridePrice` is set, uses it directly as the final price (no base/discount math). If not, falls back to existing `bundleTotal - discount` logic.
7. **StoreFront deal card:** overridePrice deals show exact price (no "From" prefix), hide discount badge.

### [2026-07-17] Add deal_category Column to Bundles + Category Grouping UI

2. **Master Schema:** Added `deal_category` to both `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bundles` and post-launch `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` block.
3. **Types:** Added `dealCategory?: 'pizza' | 'burger' | 'beverage' | 'single_item'` to `Bundle` interface in `types/index.ts`.
4. **Services:** `mapBundle` maps `row.deal_category → dealCategory`; `create` sends `deal_category`; `update` maps `data.dealCategory → updates.deal_category` and `localUpdates.dealCategory`.
5. **BundleManager.tsx:** Added `activeCategory` filter state. Bundle list now shows category filter tab bar (All/Pizza/Burger/Beverage/Single Item with counts). Bundles grouped under category section headers with colored accent bar, icon, and count badge.

5. **Verified All Products:** All 21 pizza names, descriptions, variant prices (6"/10"/13"), toppings pricing (Cheese 70/100/150, Chicken 50/80/100, Veggie 30/50/70), and beverages match the Pizza Milano menu exactly.

### [2026-07-15] 24-Hour Cancelled Orders Auto-Deletion System
**Files Updated:** `syncEngine.ts`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`

    *   Added `barcode_value TEXT` column and `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_products_barcode_value` across SQL schema and Dexie IndexedDB. Bumped Dexie IndexedDB version to v12 to seamlessly register `barcodeValue`.
2.  **Robust Code 128 Generation (`barcode.ts`, `BarcodePreview.tsx`)**:
    *   Installed `jsbarcode` and authored standard generation utility (`generateBarcodeValue`) outputting formatted `ZP-{5-digit padded integer}` hashes derived from UUID keys. Created beautiful high-fidelity SVG preview component (`BarcodePreview`) for crisp rendering across table cells and dialogs.
3.  **Universal Inventory & POS Barcode Integration (`ProductModal`, `ProductDetailHub`, `InventoryManager`, `POSTerminal`, `ProductGrid`)**:
    *   Added live Code 128 SVG previews and auto-generation across Add & Edit product modals. Embedded inline barcode display cells into inventory tables. Built custom hardware scanner hook (`useHardwareScanner`) with 50ms rapid USB HID keystroke buffering and integrated it into POS for instantaneous scan-to-cart operations.

**Changes:**
1.  **State-of-the-Art Accessible Help Tooltips (`HelpTooltip.tsx`)**:
    *   Created an inline, fully animated hover and click tooltip component (`HelpTooltip`) equipped with a subtle trigger icon, z-index isolation (`z-[700]`), and pointer-event passthrough to explain advanced features without cluttering the UI or blocking interactions.
2.  **Product Management Tooltips (`ProductModal.tsx`, `ProductDetailHub.tsx`)**:
    *   Embedded expert-density tooltips across Add and Edit Product dialogs explaining Core Identifiers (Name, SKU, Barcode, Category, Supplier), Inventory Financials & Controls (Price, Cost, Active Tracking, Initial Stock, Low Stock Warning), and POS Enhancements (Service Item vs Tracked Item, IMEI/Serial Device Prompt).
3.  **Active POS Cart Tooltips (`Cart.tsx`)**:
    *   Added helpful tooltips explaining Cart Session accumulation, Instant Cart Wiping (Clear Cart), Editing Sale atomic replacement, Customer Linking (Credit tracking, loyalty, WhatsApp receipt), Bill-wide Discount controls, and Save Draft / Hold Order functionality.

5.  **Module Import Resolution (`CheckoutPage.tsx`)**:
    *   Fixed a syntax error where `queueOp` was incorrectly imported from `services` instead of `localDb`, guaranteeing flawless build execution and offline queue hydration during standalone checkout.

### [2026-05-19] Offline Persistence & Reporting Parity Fixes
**Files Updated:** `services.ts`, `ReportsManager.tsx`, `TransactionsManager.tsx`
**Changes:**
1.  **Universal `workspaceId` Hydration (`services.ts`)**:
    *   Resolved a critical bug where objects mapped from Supabase rows (`mapProduct`, `mapCustomer`, `mapSale`, `mapExpense`, `mapUser`, `mapShift`, `mapDiscount`, `mapPurchaseRecord`, `mapProductBatch`, `suppliers`, `supplier_transactions`, `stock_history`) failed to map `item.workspace_id` to `item.workspaceId`. When saved to local IndexedDB (`localDb`), records lacked the `workspaceId` property, causing local and fallback reporting queries to return empty data offline or upon reload.
2.  **Robust Local Filter Parity (`services.ts`)**:
    *   Updated `getReportSalesLocal`, `getReportSales` fallback, `getReportRefundsLocal`, `getReportRefunds` fallback, `getReportExpensesLocal`, `getReportExpenses` fallback, and `searchSales` fallback to accept both `workspaceId` and `workspace_id` properties.
3.  **Reporting State Hydration (`ReportsManager.tsx`)**:
    *   Ensured `setReportSales`, `setReportRefunds`, and `setReportExpenses` are always executed during local database fetch, eliminating stale report data when querying date ranges with empty results.
4.  **Offline Transaction Search (`TransactionsManager.tsx`)**:
    *   Removed `navigator.onLine` block during search, allowing the app to seamlessly execute local IndexedDB search fallback when offline or disconnected.

### [2026-05-19] Financial Flow Audit & Credit Sales Reporting Parity
**Files Updated:** `services.ts`, `ReportsManager.tsx`, `DashboardManager.tsx`, `CheckoutModal.tsx`, `POSTerminal.tsx`
**Changes:**
1.  **Cloud Stock Sync Fix on Return/Refund (`services.ts`)**:
    *   Discovered and resolved a critical omission in `returnSale` where restored product stock was updated locally but never queued for cloud synchronization via `queueOp('products', ...)`. Perfect cloud vs. local inventory sync restored.
2.  **Reporting & Dashboard Revenue Parity (`ReportsManager.tsx`, `DashboardManager.tsx`)**:
    *   Identified a major reporting discrepancy where credit sales (`status === 'credit'`) were omitted from revenue totals, transaction counts, feature analytics, and dashboard hourly charts while their COGS was still being counted.
    *   Standardized status checks (`s.status === 'completed' || s.status === 'credit'`) across all revenue and transaction metrics to ensure 100% accurate profit and revenue calculations.
3.  **Cash Drawer Verification Parity (`CheckoutModal.tsx`)**:
    *   Updated cash sales calculation for drawer opening cash validation to accurately include cash portions of split credit sales.
4.  **Code Cleanup**:
    *   Removed unused legacy import in `POSTerminal.tsx`.

### [2026-05-19] Comprehensive App Audit, Date Parity & Unlocking Intelligence Reports
**Files Updated:** `ReportsManager.tsx`, `TransactionsManager.tsx`, `ExpenseManager.tsx`, `PurchaseHistory.tsx`
**Changes:**
1.  **ReportsManager Unlocked Premium Tabs**:
    *   Exposed previously hidden `CUSTOMERS` and `EXPENSES` intelligence reports in chip navigation bar and JSX render layout.
2.  **Universal Date Filtering Perfection**:
    *   Added standard `ALL TIME` (`all`) option across `ReportsManager`, `TransactionsManager`, `ExpenseManager`, and `PurchaseHistory` date range selector dropdowns.
    *   Standardized date boundaries across all filtering hooks to ensure 100% calculation parity.
3.  **Complexity Cleanup**:
    *   Removed unused legacy `shiftFilter` state and filtering logic from `TransactionsManager` to maintain clean architecture.

### [2026-05-19] Edit Product Sync + Customer Module Simplification
**Files Updated:** `ProductDetailHub.tsx`, `CustomerModal.tsx`, `CustomerDetailModal.tsx`
**Changes:**
1.  **ProductDetailHub (Edit Mode) — Full Universal POS Parity**:
    *   Added `isService` toggle: Marks product as a service (disables stock tracking auto).
    *   Added `requireSerial` toggle: Forces IMEI/Serial prompt at POS for this product.
    *   Added `variants` builder: Add/remove size, color, material variant options (matches ProductModal).
    *   Added `modifiers` builder: Add/remove add-ons with pricing (e.g. Extra Cheese, Warranty).
    *   All 4 new fields now saved on product update via `productsService.update()`.
2.  **Customer Module Simplification**:
    *   Replaced all complex CRM/tech jargon with plain English labels.
    *   "Intelligence Profile" → "Details", "Purchase Archive" → "Transactions".
    *   "Settlement Core" → "Add Payment", "Liability Balance" → "Amount Due".
    *   "Commit Settlement" → "Add Payment", "Cash Flow" → "Cash", "E-Transfer" → "Bank Transfer".
    *   "Close Profile" → "Close", error messages simplified throughout.
    *   No functional changes — all existing payment and data linkages preserved.

### [2026-05-19] Universal Date Filtering Parity & Dynamic Ledger Sync
**Files Updated:** `CustomerManager.tsx`, `SupplierManager.tsx`, `SupplierLedger.tsx`
**Changes:**
1.  **CustomerManager Date Filtering**:
    *   Standardized date selection dropdown (`today`, `yesterday`, `last7`, `thisMonth`, `lastMonth`, `custom`, `all`).
    *   Implemented dynamic customer purchases calculation (`getCustomerTotalPurchases`) to reflect active date range instantly on table rows and mobile summary cards.
2.  **Supplier Module Parity**:
    *   Standardized date boundaries and selector options in `SupplierManager.tsx`.
    *   Passed date boundaries (`validStartDate`, `validEndDate`) down to `SupplierLedger.tsx`.
    *   Filtered supplier ledger transactions dynamically to ensure absolute date filtering parity across the supply chain module.

### [2026-05-19] Modal Top Cropping Fix & POS Universal Enhancements Parity
**Files Updated:** `ModernModal.tsx`, `CheckoutPage.tsx`, `CheckoutModal.tsx`, `InventoryManager.tsx`
**Changes:**
1.  **Modal Top Cropping Permanent Fix (`ModernModal.tsx`)**:
    *   Resolved a flexbox centering layout bug where tall modals (like the Product Modal or Bulk Edit Modal) were cropped at the top edge of the screen on desktop and mobile viewports.
    *   Replaced `items-center` with `items-start pt-16 sm:pt-20 pb-16` and applied `my-auto` to the modal container. If the modal is shorter than the viewport, it perfectly centers vertically; if taller, it aligns to the top padding, guaranteeing full scrollability without clipping the top close button or headers.
2.  **Universal POS Enhancements Parity (`CheckoutPage.tsx`, `CheckoutModal.tsx`, `InventoryManager.tsx`)**:
    *   Audited the full flow for `isService` (Service Items without stock) and `requireSerial` (IMEI/Serial scanning prompt at POS).
    *   Added full rendering support for `selectedVariant`, `selectedModifiers` (add-ons), and `serialNumber` directly into the order summary items list on `CheckoutPage.tsx` and `CheckoutModal.tsx`, matching the existing high-fidelity display in `Cart.tsx` and `ReceiptPrint.tsx`.
    *   Added dedicated Item Type filter (`All Items`, `Standard Products`, `Service Items`, `IMEI / Serialized`) and visual pill badges directly to the main `InventoryManager.tsx` table and mobile cards for premium expert density and rapid filtering.

**Changes:**
1.  **Users & Permissions Link Tree & Module Access Control (`types/index.ts`, `UserModal.tsx`, `Header.tsx`, `App.tsx`)**:
    *   Synchronized active navigation route matching in `App.tsx` and module tab visibility in `Header.tsx`.
    *   Added full granular Module Access Control checkboxes (`access_inventory`, `access_expenses`, `access_customers`, `access_reports`) directly into `UserModal.tsx` for real-time permission toggling.
2.  **Supplier & Expenses Link Tree (`SupplierLedger.tsx`, `ExpenseManager.tsx`, `types/index.ts`)**:
    *   Enforced active shift validation before recording supplier payments or manual expenses.
    *   Added missing `workspaceId`, `workspace_id`, and `addedBy` fields to `Expense` interface and ensured auto-generated expenses correctly hydrate them for flawless offline and reporting sync.
3.  **POS Atomic Bill Edit Parity (`CheckoutPage.tsx`)**:
    *   Standardized the state-of-the-art safe two-phase create-then-delete bill editing pattern with fallback voiding in `CheckoutPage.tsx` to perfectly mirror `CheckoutModal.tsx`, eliminating any potential for corrupted inventory or lost revenue during bill edits.

### [2026-05-18] Universal POS Products & Advanced Reporting
**Files Updated:** `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `types/index.ts`, `services.ts`, `ProductModal.tsx`, `POSTerminal.tsx`, `Cart.tsx`, `ReceiptPrint.tsx`
**Changes:**

    *   Added `recentSales` ledger in `InventoryReportManager` to track item-level sales dates.

### [2026-05-09] POS Enhancements, Split Payments & DC Charges
**Files Updated:** `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `localDb.ts`, `types/index.ts`, `services.ts`
**Changes:**
1.  **Sales Table**:
    *   Added `extra_charges` (JSONB): Consolidated DC and other charges into a single flexible array.
    *   Added `split_payments` (JSONB): Support for multi-method payments.
    *   Removed legacy `dc_number`, `other_amount` columns.
2.  **App Settings Table**:
    *   Added `enable_split_payment` (BOOLEAN): Toggle for multi-payment UI.
    *   Added `enable_extra_charges` (BOOLEAN): Toggle for DC Charges (E-Store only).
    *   Added `allow_credit_over_limit` (BOOLEAN): Enforcement of customer credit limits.
    *   Added advanced Barcode settings: `barcode_content_scale`, `barcode_font_size`, `barcode_name_lines`, etc.

3.  **Realtime**:
    *   Updated `supabase_realtime` publication to include all new core tables.

### [2026-05-09] Audit Fixes — split_payments, RLS, get_my_workspace_id
**Files Updated:** `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `supabase/migrations/20260509191900_split_payments_rls_fix.sql`
**Changes:**
1.  **Sales Table**:
    *   `split_payments` column was in schema & code but NOT in live DB. Applied `ALTER TABLE sales ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS split_payments JSONB DEFAULT '[]'`.
2.  **RLS Security**:
    *   `get_my_workspace_id()` function was missing from live DB — deployed as SECURITY DEFINER.
    *   `app_settings` policies were `qual=true` (allowed all rows) — replaced with workspace-scoped SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies.
    *   `users` SELECT/UPDATE policies were `qual=true` — replaced with `id = auth.uid() OR workspace_id = get_my_workspace_id()`.
    *   SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql updated to deploy function + policies in correct order on fresh installs.
3.  **Audit Finding — Batch NULL** (data issue, not code):
    *   12 products have `track_inventory=true`, but only 1 has rows in `product_batches`.
    *   Root cause: products created before FIFO batch system was deployed.
    *   Code correctly handles this (FIFO logic skips if no batches, falls back to product.cost).
    *   No code fix needed — data-level backfill can be done manually if COGS precision is required.

### [2026-07-17] Full Deal System Audit — Burger Meal Deal Fix, Burger Products Created, Duplicate Deleted

4. **Drink Price Verified:** 1 Liter Drink confirmed at Rs160 (correct) — no Rs180 found anywhere in DB.
5. **Crown Crust Deal:** Already Fixed Bundle (`is_combo=false`) with correct items (Crown Crust + Seekh Kabab pizzas). No change needed.
6. **Sunday Deals:** Kept as Slot-Based (`is_combo=true`) — mandatory for "pick your flavor" functionality. Discount values (50/200/300) produce correct final prices (Rs550/750/1050) when variant pricing is used.
7. **3 Pizza Deals:** Verified all slots pull from 21 real pizza products with correct discount tiers (10%/15%/20%).
8. **Deal Images:** All 8 bundles have real product photos set.

### [2026-07-17] Crown Crust Deal: Fixed Bundle → Slot-Based → Split Into 4 Size-Specific Deals
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260717130000_crown_crust_slot_based.sql`, `supabase/migrations/20260717140000_split_crown_seekh_into_sizes.sql`, `src/components/estore/StoreDealModal.tsx`, `src/components/estore/StoreFront.tsx`, `src/components/pos/ProductGrid.tsx`, `GEMINI.md`
**Changes:**
1. **DB (Migration 17130000):** Crown Crust Deal converted from fixed bundle (2 forced items) to slot-based (1 slot, 2 options: Crown Crust OR Seekh Kabab).
2. **StoreDealModal:** Added size toggle + variant pricing + toppings sync for slot-based deals. Pricing useMemo uses selected option's variant price. `showSizeToggle`/`tierLabels` extracted as shared hooks for both slot and fixed paths.
3. **StoreFront + ProductGrid price range fix:** Per-slot `bundleMinPrice`/`bundleMaxPrice` calculation (was summing all options' ranges together, giving 2650–3800 instead of 1300–1950).
4. **Migration 17140000 (this change):** Customer feedback — no mixed "choose one" deals. Reverted Crown Crust Deal to single-item fixed bundle (Crown Crust Pizza qty:1). Created 3 new fixed bundles: `Crown Crust Deal - Large` (1850), `Seekh Kabab Deal - Medium` (1350), `Seekh Kabab Deal - Large` (1950). All 4 deals use `override_price` for fixed pricing + `highlight_tag='crown'`.
5. **nameBasedTier:** Added `nameBasedTier` useMemo that auto-derives variant tier from bundle name (`- Medium`→0, `- Large`→1) for override_price deals. `showSizeToggle` returns false when override_price set. `getItemPrice`/`itemPrice` use `nameBasedTier` when available, else `selectedSizeTier`.
6. **handleAdd variant pricing:** Uses `effectiveTier` (name-based or toggle-based) to recalculate cart subtotals with correct variant `priceOverride`.

### [2026-07-18] Variation Inventory — Per-Variant Stock + Add-On Products
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260718010000_variation_inventory.sql`, `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `types/index.ts`, `localDb.ts`, `services.ts`, `syncEngine.ts`
**Changes:**
1. **Schema Migration:** New `variant_stock_history` table (per-variant stock audit trail) and `product_addons` table (inventory-tracked add-on products). Added to both `CREATE TABLE` and post-launch `ALTER TABLE` blocks.
2. **Types:** `VariantData` gains `cardTitle`, `cardSubtitle` for display labels. New `VariantStockHistory`, `ProductAddon`, `CartAddonItem` interfaces. `CartItem` gains `selectedVariantId`, `selectedVariantLabel`, `addonItems`.
3. **localDb:** Version 18 adds `variantStockHistory` + `productAddons` Dexie tables. `PendingOpEntity` includes `variant_stock_history` and `product_addons`. Seeding + TABLE_TO_ENTITY updated.
4. **services.ts:** `mapVariantStockHistory` / `toRemoteVariantStockHistory` / `mapProductAddon` / `toRemoteProductAddon` mappers added. New `variantStockHistoryService` and `productAddonsService`. `salesService.create` now deducts variant stock + logs variant stock history; addon product stock deducted independently.
5. **syncEngine.ts:** `variant_stock_history` and `product_addons` registered in `tableMap`.

### [2026-07-10] POST_DUMP_REPAIR removed, merged into SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA
**Files Updated:** `supabase/schema/SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql` (+data integrity section), `supabase/migrations/20260710020000_create_missing_bundle_tables.sql` (+GRANTs)
**Changes:**
1.  **POST_DUMP_REPAIR.sql** deleted — all content already existed in SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql (columns, indexes, functions, RLS, replica identity, realtime). Only data integrity backfill (product_batches + stock_history) was missing — now added at the end.
2.  **bundle_slots & bundle_slot_options** created via migration + GRANT SELECT added for anon/authenticated/service_role.
3.  `AGENTS.md` & `GEMINI.md` migration rules updated — removed POST_DUMP_REPAIR references.

### [2026-07-10] Drop workspace_id — Single-tenant architecture
**Files Updated:** All app code (services.ts, components, types, hooks, etc.), `src/lib/localDb.ts`, `src/lib/masterSchema.ts`, `src/lib/constants.ts`, `supabase/schema/SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `supabase/migrations/20260710030000_drop_workspace_id.sql`
**Changes:**
1.  **Migration run:** `workspace_id` column dropped from all 18 tables (app_settings, categories, customers, suppliers, products, product_batches, discounts, users, sales, expenses, sales_tabs, purchase_records, purchase_orders, purchase_order_items, supplier_transactions, payments, stock_history, bundles).
2.  **Index:** `idx_bundles_name_workspace` → `idx_bundles_name_unique` (unique bundle name globally, not per-workspace).
3.  **Functions:** `get_my_workspace_id()` returns `auth.uid()`. `handle_new_user()` no longer sets workspace_id. `process_sale()` RPC no longer reads/writes workspace_id.
4.  **App code:** All `.eq('workspace_id', ...)` filters, workspaceId params, mappers returning workspaceId, and useWorkspaceId hook removed. BundleGrid cards now have ± quantity stepper.
5.  **1 Clone = 1 Shop** — changing project credentials no longer causes workspace_id mismatch issues.

### [2026-07-10] Remote Column Parity, Settings Realtime Filter, and Bundle Quantity Stepper Fix
**Files Updated:** `supabase/schema/SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `supabase/migrations/20260710164500_add_variant_data_modifiers_to_products.sql`, `src/context/SupabaseAppContext.tsx`, `src/components/pos/ProductGrid.tsx`, `src/components/settings/Settings.tsx`, `src/main.tsx`
**Changes:**
1.  **Database Columns Parity (`SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `20260710164500_add_variant_data_modifiers_to_products.sql`)**:
    *   Applied live `ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN` migration for `variant_data` and `modifiers` JSONB fields. Added log entries to schema change log. Resolves the product sync 400 Bad Request error.
2.  **Defensive Singleton Settings Sync (`SupabaseAppContext.tsx`, `Settings.tsx`)**:
    *   Filtered the Realtime `app_settings` subscription to only apply changes when `payload.new.id === SETTINGS_ID`.
    *   Forced the local IndexedDB settings loader to find the record matching `SETTINGS_ID`.
    *   Standardized theme default values in `Settings.tsx` to `'dark'` to match `index.html` and the context initialization.
    *   Resolves settings (theme, POS columns) changing automatically and reverting from 7 to 4 when other clients updated their settings records.
3.  **Active Bundle Stepper Controls (`ProductGrid.tsx`)**:
    *   Replaced the hardcoded '1' value on the bundle grid cards with the calculated `bundleQty` in cart.
    *   Rewrote the bundle increment/decrement quantity logic so that pressing `-` reduces the quantity incrementally (e.g. 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> delete) rather than wiping the entire item immediately. Matches normal product card density stepper controls.
4.  **Quiet Consoles (`main.tsx`, `SupabaseAppContext.tsx`)**:
    *   Configured React Router v7 future flags (`v7_startTransition`, `v7_relativeSplatPath`) on `<BrowserRouter>` to silence upgrade warnings.
    *   Downgraded realtime disconnect/retry console logs from warning (`console.warn`) to standard info (`console.log`) level.
### [2026-07-14] E-Store Integration - Phase 1 Schema
**Files Updated:** `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`
**Changes:**
1.  **products table:** Added `show_in_estore BOOLEAN DEFAULT true` to control online visibility.
2.  **sales table:** Added `estore_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'`, `delivery_address TEXT`, `delivery_fee DECIMAL(12,2) DEFAULT 0`, `customer_notes TEXT`.
3.  **Idempotent Schema:** Added `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` block in `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql` for post-launch updates.

✅ **All Done!**

### [2026-07-24] Full Inventory Integrity Audit + Reconciliation Tool
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260724000000_fix_legacy_batches.sql`, `SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql`, `PurchaseHistory.tsx`, `SupabaseAppContext.tsx`, `CheckoutModal.tsx`, `services.ts`, `InventoryManager.tsx`, `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md`
**Changes:**
1. **DB Migration:** Fixed 12 stock/batch mismatches — deleted 2 phantom LEGACY-BACKFILL-001 batches (999K+ qty), corrected 4 legacy batch quantities, created 4 corrective batches for orphan stock, reset 1 negative stock to 0. All corrections logged to stock_history with `[RECONCILE]` prefix.
2. **PurchaseHistory.tsx:** `handleDeleteRecord()` now correctly restores batch `qty_remaining`, updates embedded `product.batches[]`, and logs `stock_history` entry on purchase record deletion.
3. **SupabaseAppContext.tsx:** `DELETE_SALE` reducer now uses `(total - refundedAmount)` instead of bare `total` for customer credit/purchases reversal. Removed unused `isReturn` variable.
4. **CheckoutModal.tsx:** Bill-edit failure now rollbacks the new sale's stock deduction via `salesService.delete(savedSale.id)` before marking old sale as void (matches CheckoutPage.tsx pattern).
5. **services.ts:** Added `reconcileAllStock(autoFix?: boolean)` — scans all tracked products, compares `products.stock` vs `SUM(product_batches.qty_remaining)`, optionally auto-fixes with corrective batches + stock_history logging.
6. **InventoryManager.tsx:** Added purple "Reconcile" button (Shield icon) in inventory toolbar — one-click stock integrity scan + auto-fix.
7. **GEMINI.md:** Added rules F9 (purchase delete must restore batches), F10 (bill edit must rollback on failure), F11 (reconcile tool must exist).
8. **SUPER_MASTER_SCHEMA.sql:** Added schema change log entry, fixed `variant_stock_history` type CHECK to include `stock_in` and `adjustment_out`.
